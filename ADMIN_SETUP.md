## Admin Account Instructions

To create the admin account with email `admin@gmail.com` and password `125050.Lit`:

1. Go to your auth page and sign up with:
   - Email: admin@gmail.com
   - Password: 125050.Lit

2. After signing up, I need to add the admin role to this account. Please let me know once you've signed up so I can add the admin role to the database.

Once the admin role is added, you'll be able to access:
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard with stats and overview
- `/admin/applications` - Manage loan applications (approve/reject)
- `/support` - View and reply to support requests

Regular users will only see their own dashboard without support requests.
