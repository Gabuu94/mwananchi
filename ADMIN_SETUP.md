**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to `/auth` and sign up with the credentials above
2. After signing up, let me know so I can add the admin role to your account

**Admin Access:**
Once the admin role is added, you'll be able to access:

Regular users will only see their own dashboard without support requests.
